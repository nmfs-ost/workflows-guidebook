The topics are contingent on need and any topics that might have come up throughout the month before the meeting.\nOccasionally, a request to discuss a topic from an outside party may arise and, when relevant, it will be added to the agenda.\nSteering committee members are encouraged to preview the agenda or add their own topics when the need arises.\nThe agenda and notes can be found in a living Google document (viewable and editable by the steering committee and internal NOAA HQ team).\n\n\nFeedback Deadlines\nWhen review or feedback is request on the project for the steering committee, a 2-4 week deadline is typically given to provide ample time for review and consideration.\n\n\nAnnual Meeting\nEach year, we will hold a meeting to review:\n\nCommittee membership.
