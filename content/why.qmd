## Don't like using `gh-pages`?

In some cases, you don't want your website on the `gh-pages` branch. For example, if you are creating releases and you want the website pages archived in that release, then you won't want your website pages on the `gh-pages` branch.

Here are the changes you need to make if you to avoid `gh-pages` branch.

* At the top of `_quarto.yml` add the following:
```
project: 
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```
* On GitHub under Settings > Pages set pages to be made from the `main` branch and the docs directory.
* Make sure `docs` is not listed in `.gitignore`
* Publish the site the first time locally using `quarto publish` from the terminal
* Change the GitHub Action because you can't use `quarto publish gh-pages`. You'll need to push to the main branch yourself (in the GitHub Action)
```
on:
  push:
    branches: main
