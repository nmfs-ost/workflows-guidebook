# Role of the Steering Committee

The workflows steering committee serves as an advisory group to provide strategic guidance, feedback, and expertise on stock assessment workflows at NOAA Fisheries. The committee's primary role is to ensure that the development and implementation of reproducible workflows align with the needs and priorities of NOAA Fisheries science centers and offices.

The steering committee members are expected to:
- Attend monthly virtual meetings to discuss project updates, challenges, and opportunities
- Review and provide feedback on project plans, documentation, and deliverables
- Share insights and best practices from their respective regions and areas of expertise
- Advocate for the adoption of reproducible workflows within their organizations
- Collaborate with the workflows team to identify and address any barriers to implementation

Please see @sec-membership on what a steering committee is responsible to do when they are no longer able to serve the committee.

# Governance

In this guidebook, we want to explicitly define our governance structure in order to reduce issues in power imbalances, establish consistent decision-making processes, and  establish clear roles and accountability for both the steering committee and workflows team.

We operate under a mix of benevolent dictator and consensus governance models where a consensus involves a series of voting with majority or all in agreement upon decisions on major development milestones and the direction of the project. While this governance style considers the input of all members of the steering committee, it can often be slow and result in decision paralysis. To mitigate this, the workflows team lead holds the final decision-making authority, allowing for more efficient progress while still valuing the contributions of the steering committee. This is why we have established an mix of benevolent dictator and consensus governance models. The benevolent dictator will make final decisions on behalf of the team and ensure progress is made in a timely manner.

One of the various ways to make decisions is through voting. The "voting chip" feature found in Google docs is used often to provide a count in support or against a particular decision. An organizer can add voting chips into any Google doc through either typing "@vote" then selecting an option in the drop down or clicking on "Insert" in the top menu, then "Smart chips", and finally "Vote".

The number of votes will often determine prioritization of tasks or features to be implemented. The workflows team lead will consider the votes and feedback from the steering committee when making final decisions. Finally, we aim to be transparent in our decision making and document the process through meeting notes.


## Membership {#sec-membership}

Steering committee members have the option to rotate off of the group given they provide a sufficient replacement  before their departure. This ensures continuity and the infusion of fresh perspectives within the committee.

<!-- thoughts on the below addition. might need to be in what instead -->
An annual review is will be conducted to provide opportunity for the steering committee to evaluate their membership and discuss any potential changes. This review will also allow the workflows team to assess the effectiveness of the committee and make adjustments as needed.

When a member decides to step down from the steering committee, they are encouraged to recommend a suitable replacement from their organization or network. The recommended individual should possess relevant expertise and a commitment to advancing reproducible workflows within NOAA Fisheries.
