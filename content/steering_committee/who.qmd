## Membership {#sec-membership}

Steering committee members have the option to rotate off of the group given they provide a sufficient replacement  before their departure. This ensures continuity and the infusion of fresh perspectives within the committee.

<!-- thoughts on the below addition. might need to be in what instead -->
An annual review is will be conducted to provide opportunity for the steering committee to evaluate their membership and discuss any potential changes. This review will also allow the workflows team to assess the effectiveness of the committee and make adjustments as needed.

When a member decides to step down from the steering committee, they are encouraged to recommend a suitable replacement from their organization or network. The recommended individual should possess relevant expertise and a commitment to advancing reproducible workflows within NOAA Fisheries.
